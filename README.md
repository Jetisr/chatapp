# A Simple Chat App

This is a very simple chat app that I've been working on to get more experience with React & Apollo. Mostly I want to get more accustomed to using Apollo's cache as a replacement for Redux.

## Running the app

### Install Dependencies

```
git clone chat-app git@github.com:Jetisr/chatapp.git
cd chat-app/backend/
yarn
cd ../frontend/
yarn
```

### Actually running it

Open two terminals, and in one go to the backend directory and run `yarn start:dev`, and in the other go to the frontend directory and run `yarn start`.

This will create a new database, and launch the app in your default browser.
